        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Originally formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1946, our firm was known as Thomas & Associates.  After a reorganization in 1952 the firm was renamed Thomas, Carpenter, Craig & Ziska.  Allen Wapnick joined the firm in 1957.  Brian Fialko and Lawrence Yunaska joined in 1983 and David Lerner became our firm's newest partner in 2005.  The firm has been known as William Thomas & Associates since 1998.</p>
        <p>Our team currently includes our four partners, a Firm Administrator, and six Accounting Team Members. Each team member has their own unique skills obtained through many hours of on-going educational training.
